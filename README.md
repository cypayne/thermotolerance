# Genomic insights into swordtail (Xiphophorus) thermotolerance

This repository contains all code and data files used to perform QTL mapping and 
gene expression and co-expression analyses to study the underlying genomic 
architecture of thermotolerance in swordtails, most recently published in Payne et al 2022. 

## Contents

* **QTL mapping scripts**

  * Pipeline for mapping critical thermal maximum (CTmax) QTL for
    artificial X. malinche x X. birchmanni hybrids.

* **Expression analysis scripts** 

  * Scripts used to perform differential gene expression analysis
    with tissue-level RNAseq data obtained from an ambient vs thermal stress 
    experiment with X. malinche, X. birchmanni, and F1 hybrids.

* **ThermTol WGCNA analysis scripts** 

  * Scripts used to create and explore gene co-expression networks for brain 
    and liver RNAseq thermal stress experiment data.

* **input files**
  * All data files required to run all scripts contained in this repository 
    and reproduce analyses in Payne et al 2022.
